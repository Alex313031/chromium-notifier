# Chromium Update Notifications

This extension will periodically check [Woolyss' website](https://chromium.woolyss.com/) and display a "New" icon badge once the version found for the selected platform/tag is different to the one you're currently using. Nothing more, nothing less.

As of version 1.1.0, tracking and 1-click-installing of updates for all installed extensions is supported too (which support auto-updating). Just be aware that if you enable this, extension update info will need to be fetched via [chromium-extension-service](https://github.com/kkkrist/chromium-extension-service) to bypass [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). This entails that a list of your installed extensions will need to be transmitted to the service.

## Installation

1. Review source code
2. Clone repository or download a [release](https://github.com/kkkrist/chromium-notifier/releases) and unpack into a local folder
3. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Enable developer mode
4. Drag-and-drop the folder into the browser window or click on "Load unpacked extension" and select folder

## Configuration

Click on the extension's icon, select platform (mac, win32 or win64) and tag â€“ i.e. the Chromium version you're using and enable tracking of extension updates if desired.

## Extension developers

If you want to have your GitHub-hosted Chromium extension tracked via this plugin, follow these steps:

1. Include `github:<user>/<repo>` as `update_url` in your `manifest.json`.
2. Make sure to tag your versions. If the current `version` spicified in your `manifest.json` equals to `1.2.3`, there needs to be a tag named `v1.2.3` in your repo to make the download links work.
