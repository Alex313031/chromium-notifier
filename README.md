# Chromium Update Notifications

This extension will periodically check [Woolyss' website](https://chromium.woolyss.com/) and display a "New" icon badge once the version for the configured platform and tag is different to the one you're currently using. Nothing more, nothing less.

2. Clone repository or download a [release](https://github.com/kkkrist/chromium-notifier/releases) and unpack it into a local folder
3. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Enable developer mode
4. Drag-and-drop the folder into the browser window or click on "Load unpacked extension" and select folder

## Configuration
